    <h2>Some history...</h2>
    <p>
        The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, 
        on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular 
        in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America 
        and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and 
        via pizza delivery. Various food companies also sell ready-baked frozen pizzas in grocery stores, to be reheated in an ordinary 
        home oven.

    <h3>Pizza Margherita in 4 easy steps!</h3>

    <ol>
      <li> Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
          Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a 
          wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface 
          and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the 
          dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. </li>
      <li> Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. 
          Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
      <li> Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.
          On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.
          The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. </li>
      <li> Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray 
          in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and 
          tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated 
          sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. 
          Repeat step for remaining pizza. </li>
    </ol>
